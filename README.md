# Game of Thrones - Authoring 2

This project was made over the course of term 2 at Fanshawe College for the Interactive Media Design Program. I also learned some key concepts in my first term.

## Motivation

While I have never seen the show, I was very motivated to finish this project. After I watched those amazing house introduction trailers, I knew it was game time! 

## Usage

You could use this project to learn more about the show "Game of Thrones" (GOT). As a GOT professional, I'm sure someone could learn more from this.

## inspiration
